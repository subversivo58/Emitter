## Versioning information

This software is being produced using semantic versioning description, comment tags (@version) in substantial parts of the source code may indicate the version `0.1.0` subjectively used to describe the **"development stage"**.


In summary the versioning follows this order: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g: 1.0.0)

The **MAJOR** version indicates when the software receives changes (updates) that make it incompatible with the previous version

The **MINOR** version indicates when the software receives changes (updates) but is still compatible with previous versions (within the current MAJOR segment)

The **PATCH** version indicates when the software receives bug fixes but is still compatible with previous versions (within the current MINOR segment)
